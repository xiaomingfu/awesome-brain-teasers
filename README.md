#### Q9: Truth and lie 

Question:  You live on an island where there are only two kinds of people: 
the ones who always tell the truth (truth tellers) and those who always lie (liars). You are accused of crime and brought before the court, where you are allowed to speak only one sentence in your defense. What do you say in each of the following situations? 

•	If you were a liar (the court does not know that) and you were innocent. And it is an established fact that a liar committed the crime.

•	Same situation as above, but you are the one who committed the crime.

•	If you were a truth teller (the court does not know that) and you were innocent. And it is an established fact that a truth teller committed the crime.

•	If you were innocent and it is an established fact that the crime was not committed by a "normal" person. Normal people are that new immigrant group who sometimes lie and sometimes speak the truth. What sentence, no matter whether you were a truth teller, liar, or normal, can prove your innocence?

#### Q10: Prisoner math

There was a king who had 100 prisoners who used to be mathematicians. Everyone’s head was shaved bald. The king said to them: “You would all be standing on a slope in a line facing downwards so that a prisoner can see all the heads in front of him.No one can turn around. Someone will write a random number between 1 to N on each of your heads.We would start asking the person at the top of the slope to guess the number of his head. You can only guess a number between 1-N. If the answer is correct, the prisoner will live, otherwise he will be killed. Then we will ask the same question to next person on the top of the slope and so on. You are allowed to discuss strategy before we start the process.” 

Question:  How can prisoners maximize the number of survivors?

Hint：if N=2, it is black and white hat question, and may be easy to find the answer.The last prisoner can count how many hats in front of him/her are black. If it's even, the prisoner will say “black”. If it's odd, he/she will say “white”.

#### Q11:	Get the last apple

There are 3 baskets. One has 3 apples, another one has 4 apples and the last one has 5 apples. Two people (A and B) get the apples out from the baskets in turn. Each time one person gets a number of apples (at least one, no more than the maximum number of apples in the basket) from only one basket. The person who gets the last apple of the three baskets will win the game. Now you are the person who is first to get apples, do you have a strategy to make sure you win the game? If yes, how? If no, why?
